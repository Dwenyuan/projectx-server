resultDes8=Custom transaction fails
resultDes9= 
resultDes10=the spend time of the custom transaction below is too big
resultDes11=If CPU is too high, or throughput limited by your network, or system I/O blocking could lead to long response time. you can enable 'WEB User Detail' by 'Controller' to output the response time of every http request, then you can find out which http request takes a long time. The time of following transaction is more than the recording time: 
resultDes12=: the maximum time is 
resultDes13=Wrong response code
resultDes14=The reason is due to receive the error code appears with the response code value is not the same when recording or in between 400-599, with the recording is not the same problem is likely to be related parameters. <br> error response codes include: 
resultDes15=If CPU is too high, or throughput limited by your network, or system I/O blocking could lead to tcp connection takes a long time. TCP connection time more than 2.9 seconds may indicate SYN packet loss retransmission. Please check the server, network, 'Agent' actuator which caused.

resultDes25= 
resultDes26=The server closes TCP
resultDes27=While waiting for a response message, a discovery TCP connection is closed. The server may be too high CPU or throughput limited by your network could lead to server close tcp
resultDes28=Failure log include "{0}", the timeout was due TCP three-way handshake to establish beyond a certain time, it is very likely to send three consecutive SYN packets received from the peer did not reply SYN-ACK. Time is generally greater than 9 seconds.

resultDes30=, Is the throughput of the application layer, the TCP/IP accounted for at least 8750 * 2%, It's greater than 90M. If your network bandwidth is 1000Mbps, you can ignore the warning; bandwidth limit may lead to the establishment of TCP failure, TCP establish a long time, the request response time is long, can not increase the number of requests and so on.
resultDes31=: The number of appearances for more than 8750 KB is 
resultDes32=, It's greater than 90M. If your network bandwidth is 1000Mbps, you can ignore the warning; bandwidth limit may lead to the establishment of TCP failure, TCP establish a long time, the request response time is long, can not increase the number of requests and so on.
resultDes33=: The number of appearances for more than 11250 KB is 
resultDes34=, It's greater than 90M. If your network bandwidth is 1000Mbps, you can ignore the warning; bandwidth limit may lead to Poor media quality, media transmitting longer.
resultDes35=When the CPU more than 80% may result in a long response time, the request fails.
resultDes36=: Greater than 80% of the number of times appears is 
resultDes37=Memory space is higher than 90%, check memory overflow or you can increase memory.
resultDes38=: Greater than 90% of the number of times appears is 
resultDes39=When the memory space available is less than 10%, check memory overflow or you can increase memory.
resultDes40=: Less than 10% of the number of times appears is 
resultDes41=: Media stream monitor failed
resultDes42=You can filter the log with "{0}" by "Analysis" to list all failed media streams.
